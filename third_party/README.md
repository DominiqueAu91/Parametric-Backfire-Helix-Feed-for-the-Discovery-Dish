Summary
Update 24-02-2025: 

**Added an adapter which can be used to mount the backfire helix on a Discovery dish**
Added S-band version scaffold
This feed is suitable for deep prime focus dishes with an f/D ratio ranging from 0.3 to 0.5. Considering the mirroring effect the dish has on signal polarization, this feed is designed as LHCP; with the dish flipping it, making reception of RHCP satellite signals suitable.
The original aim was to build a circularly polarized feed for the popular grid dish that comes with a linear polarized dipole feed. This design proven to work well not just with the grid dish, but any other deep dishes. The feed holder is designed for the Nooelec L-band grid dish, other dishes needs their own feed holder. 

Please visit the github repository for additional details and build instructions of this project. You can also find gerber files for the backplate if you want to make the backplate from PCB.

Backfire helix design is based on Hisamatsu Nakano, Junji Yamauchi, Hiroaki Mimaki: Backfire Radiation from a Monofilar Helix with a Small Ground Plane, IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION, VOL. 36, NO. 10, OCTOBER 1988

The scaffold is based on https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4980180 helix design.
